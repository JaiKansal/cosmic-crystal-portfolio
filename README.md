## ðŸŽ¨ Customization Guide

This is the most important section. Follow these steps to replace all the placeholder content with your own.

### 1\. Personal Info & Resume

This is the quickest way to make the site your own.

  * **Resume:** Replace the `Resume.pdf` file in the `/public` folder with your own PDF.
  * **Name & Title:** You need to change your name in two places:
      * **3D (Desktop):** `src/app/page.tsx` (in the `<header>`)
      * **2D (Mobile):** `src/app/components/Portfolio2D.tsx`
  * **Social Links (LinkedIn, GitHub):** You also need to change these in two places:
      * **3D (Desktop):** `src/app/page.tsx` (in the `<footer>`)
      * **2D (Mobile):** `src/app/components/Portfolio2D.tsx` (in the `<footer>`)

### 2\. Site Content (Experience, Projects, Skills)

All of your professional data is managed in one central location for easy editing.

Go to the `src/app/components/data/` folder:

  * **`experienceData.ts`**: Edit this array to add your work history.
  * **`projectData.ts`**: Edit this array to add your projects.
  * **`skillsData.ts`**: Edit this object to list your technical skills.

The 3D and 2D sites *both* read from these files, so you only have to update your info once\!

### 3\. Contact Form

The contact form is set up to use [Formspree](https://formspree.io) (a free form-handling service).

1.  Sign up for a free Formspree account.
2.  Create a new form and get your unique **Endpoint URL**.
3.  Open `src/app/components/Contact.tsx`.
4.  Find this line:
    ```tsx
    <form 
      action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_UNIQUE_ID" // <-- PASTE YOUR URL HERE
      method="POST"
      ...
    >
    ```
5.  Replace `https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_UNIQUE_ID` with your own URL.
6.  That's it\! Your form is now live and will send submissions to your email.

### 4\. Replacing the 3D Crystal Model

This is the most advanced customization. The current 3D crystal model has a **NonCommercial license**, so you **must** replace it if you plan to sell this template.

Here is the process:

1.  **Find a Model:** Go to [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/search?features=downloadable&type=models) or a similar site. Search for a model with a **`CC0` (Public Domain)** or **`CC-BY` (Commercial-OK)** license. Download it as a **`.glb`** file.
2.  **Place the Model:** Put your new `.glb` file (e.g., `new_model.glb`) into the `/public` folder.
3.  **Run the Converter:** In your terminal, run the `gltfjsx` tool to create a new component. (Make sure to delete the old `crystal-transformed.glb` and `CrystalModel.tsx` files first).
    ```bash
    npx gltfjsx public/new_model.glb -o src/app/components/NewModel.tsx -t -s -T
    ```
4.  **Edit the New Component:** Open the new `src/app/components/NewModel.tsx`. You will need to edit it to add our custom props (rotation, text, visibility, etc.).
      * You'll need to import `useFrame`, `Text`, and `useRef`.
      * You'll need to add the `CrystalModelProps` (you can copy this from the old `CrystalModel.tsx`).
      * You'll need to wrap the `<mesh>` in a `<group>` and apply the props (`position`, `visible`, `onClick`, etc.).
      * You must add the `<Text>` component back in.
      * This step requires some React Three Fiber knowledge.
5.  **Update `Scene3D.tsx`:**
      * Import your `NewModel` at the top: `import { NewModel } from './NewModel'`.
      * Replace all instances of `<CrystalModel ... />` with `<NewModel ... />`.
